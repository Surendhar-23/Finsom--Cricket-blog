        <p>
          Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven
          players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre)
          pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on
          three stumps.
        </p>
        <p>
          The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the
          wickets with the bat and then running between the wickets, while the
          bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the
          ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket)
          and dismiss each batter (so they are "out").
        </p>
        <p>
          when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the
          fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but
          before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a
          batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket.
        </p>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <h4>Orgins</h4>
        <p>
          It is generally believed that cricket originated as a children's game
          in the south-eastern counties of England, sometime during the medieval
          period. Although there are claims for prior dates, the earliest
          definite reference to cricket being played comes from evidence given
          at a court case in Guildford in January 1597 (Old Style, equating to
          January 1598 in the modern calendar).
        </p>
        <p>
          One possible source for the sport's name is the Old English word
          "cryce" (or "cricc") meaning a crutch or staff. In Samuel Johnson's
          Dictionary, he derived cricket from "cryce, Saxon, a stick". In Old
          French, the word "criquet" seems to have meant a kind of club or
          stick. Given the strong medieval trade connections between south-east
          England and the County of Flanders when the latter belonged to the
          Duchy of Burgundy, the name may have been derived from the Middle
          Dutch (in use in Flanders at the time) "krick"(-e), meaning a stick
          (crook).
        </p>
        <p>
          Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word "krickstoel", meaning
          a long low stool used for kneeling in church and which resembled the
          long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket. According to
          Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of Bonn University,
          "cricket" derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey, met de
          (krik ket)sen (i.e., "with the stick chase"). Gillmeister has
          suggested that not only the name but also the sport itself may be of
          Flemish origin
        </p>
        <h4>English cricket in the 18th and 19th centuries</h4>
        <p>
          The game underwent major development in the 18th century to become
          England's national sport. Its success was underwritten by the twin
          necessities of patronage and betting. Cricket was prominent in London
          as early as 1707 and, in the middle years of the century, large crowds
          flocked to matches on the Artillery Ground in Finsbury.[citation
          needed] The single wicket form of the sport attracted huge crowds and
          wagers to match, its popularity peaking in the 1748 season.

        <h4>Cricket becomes an international sport</h4>
        <p>
          In 1844, the first-ever international match took place between what
          were essentially club teams, from the United States and Canada, in
          Toronto; Canada won.[46][47] In 1859, a team of English players went
          to North America on the first overseas tour.[48] Meanwhile, the
          British Empire had been instrumental in spreading the game overseas
          and by the middle of the 19th century it had become well established
          in Australia, the Caribbean, British India (which includes present-day
          Pakistan and Bangladesh), New Zealand, North America and South Africa.
        </p>
        <h3>Laws and gameplay</h3>
        <p>
          In cricket, the rules of the game are specified in a code called The
          Laws of Cricket (hereinafter called "the Laws") which has a global
          remit. There are 42 Laws (always written with a capital "L"). The
          earliest known version of the code was drafted in 1744 and, since
          1788, it has been owned and maintained by its custodian, the
          Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London.
        </p>
        <h4>Playing area</h4>
        <img
          src="img/Cricketfield.svg.png"
          alt="Ground-Cricketfield"
          width="400"
          height="300"
        />
        <p>
          Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played on a cricket field (see image,
          right) between two teams of eleven players each.[64] The field is
          usually circular or oval in shape and the edge of the playing area is
          marked by a boundary, which may be a fence, part of the stands, a
          rope, a painted line or a combination of these; the boundary must if
          possible be marked along its entire length.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the approximate centre of the field is a rectangular pitch (see
          image, below) on which a wooden target called a wicket is sited at
          each end; the wickets are placed 22 yards (20 m) apart.The pitch is a
          flat surface 10 feet (3.0 m) wide, with very short grass that tends to
          be worn away as the game progresses (cricket can also be played on
          artificial surfaces, notably matting). Each wicket is made of three
          wooden stumps topped by two bails.
        </p>
        <img src="img/pitch.png" alt="Middleofpitch" height="300" />
        <p>
          As illustrated above, the pitch is marked at each end with four white
          painted lines: a bowling crease, a popping crease and two return
          creases. The three stumps are aligned centrally on the bowling crease,
          which is eight feet eight inches long. The popping crease is drawn
          four feet in front of the bowling crease and parallel to it; although
          it is drawn as a twelve-foot line (six feet either side of the
          wicket), it is, in fact, unlimited in length. The return creases are
          drawn at right angles to the popping crease so that they intersect the
          ends of the bowling crease; each return crease is drawn as an
          eight-foot line, so that it extends four feet behind the bowling
          crease, but is also, in fact, unlimited in length.
        </p>
        <h4>Innings</h4>
        <p>
          The innings (ending with 's' in both singular and plural form) is the
          term used for each phase of play during a match. Depending on the type
          of match being played, each team has either one or two innings.
          Sometimes all eleven members of the batting side take a turn to bat
          but, for various reasons, an innings can end before they have all done
          so. The innings terminates if the batting team is "all out", a term
          defined by the Laws: "at the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a
          batter, further balls remain to be bowled but no further batter is
          available to come in". In this situation, one of the batters has not
          been dismissed and is termed not out; this is because he has no
          partners left and there must always be two active batters while the
          innings is in progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          An innings may end early while there are still two not out batters:
        </p>
        <ul class="contant-list">
          <li>
            the batting team's captain may declare the innings closed even
            though some of his players have not had a turn to bat: this is a
            tactical decision by the captain, usually because he believes his
            team have scored sufficient runs and need time to dismiss the
            opposition in their innings
          </li>
          <li>
            the set number of overs (i.e., in a limited overs match) have been
            bowled
          </li>
          <li>
            the match has ended prematurely due to bad weather or running out of
            time
          </li>
          <li>
            In the final innings of the match, the batting side has reached its
            target and won the game.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Overs</h4>
        <p>
          The Laws state that, throughout an innings, "the ball shall be bowled
          from each end alternately in overs of 6 balls".The name "over" came
          about because the umpire calls "Over!" when six balls have been
          bowled. At this point, another bowler is deployed at the other end,
          and the fielding side changes ends while the batters do not. A bowler
          cannot bowl two successive overs, although a bowler can (and usually
          does) bowl alternate overs, from the same end, for several overs which
          are termed a "spell". The batters do not change ends at the end of the
          over, and so the one who was non-striker is now the striker and vice
          versa. The umpires also change positions so that the one who was at
          "square leg" now stands behind the wicket at the non-striker's end and
          vice versa
        </p>
        <h3>Player roles</h3>
        <h4>Basic gameplay: bowler to batter</h4>
        <p>
          During normal play, thirteen players and two umpires are on the field.
          Two of the players are batters and the rest are all eleven members of
          the fielding team. The other nine players in the batting team are off
          the field in the pavilion. The image with overlay below shows what is
          happening when a ball is being bowled and which of the personnel are
          on or close to the pitch.

        </ol>
        <h4>Fielding</h4>
        <img src="img/fielders.png" alt="fielders On Position" />
        <p>
          Of the eleven fielders, three are in shot in the image above. The
          other eight are elsewhere on the field, their positions determined on
          a tactical basis by the captain or the bowler. Fielders often change
          position between deliveries, again as directed by the captain or
          bowler.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a fielder is injured or becomes ill during a match, a substitute is
          allowed to field instead of him, but the substitute cannot bowl or act
          as a captain, except in the case of concussion substitutes in
          international cricket. The substitute leaves the field when the
          injured player is fit to return. The Laws of Cricket were updated in
          2017 to allow substitutes to act as wicket-keepers.
        </p>
        <h3>Spirit of the Game</h3>
        <p>
          Besides observing the Laws, cricketers must respect the "Spirit of
          Cricket", a concept encompassing sportsmanship, fair play and mutual
          respect. This spirit has long been considered an integral part of the
          sport but is only nebulously defined. Amidst concern that the spirit
          was weakening, in 2000 a Preamble was added to the Laws instructing
          all participants to play within the spirit of the game. The Preamble
          was last updated in 2017, now opening with the line
        </p>
        <p>
          "Cricket owes much of its appeal and enjoyment to the fact that it
          should be played not only according to the Laws, but also within the
          Spirit of Cricket"
